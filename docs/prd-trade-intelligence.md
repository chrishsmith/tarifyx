| Goal | Success Metric |
|------|----------------|
| **Expand TAM** | Move beyond duty calculation to capture trade intelligence market |
| **Increase stickiness** | Users come for classification, stay for intelligence |
| **Enable upsell** | Free → Paid tier conversion via premium data |
| **Competitive moat** | Features they can't easily copy (AI reasoning, optimization) |

## 4. DETAILED FEATURE SPECS

### 4.1 FTA Rules Engine & Qualification Calculator

**Problem:** CustomsInfo shows FTA rules but doesn't help users APPLY them.

**Solution:** 
1. Index all FTA rules of origin by HTS code
2. Let users input their Bill of Materials
3. Calculate if they qualify (RVC, tariff shift)
4. Show potential duty savings

**User Flow:**
```
1. User classifies product → gets HTS 8471.30.0100
2. System shows: "5 FTAs may apply"
3. User clicks "Check USMCA Qualification"
4. User enters BOM with origin of each component
5. System calculates: "RVC = 67% ✓ (minimum 60%)"
6. System shows: "You qualify! Save $X in duties"
```

**Data Required:**
- FTA text from USTR (free)
- Rules structured by HTS (we index)
- User's BOM data (user input)

**Competitive Advantage:** Neither Datamyne nor CustomsInfo does this!

---

### 4.2 Denied Party Screening

**Problem:** CustomsInfo has basic lookup, links out to OFAC for details.

**Solution:**
1. Ingest all 10+ government denied party lists
2. Build unified search interface
3. Add batch screening capability
4. Provide audit trail/reports

**Lists to Ingest:**
| List | Source | Update Frequency |
|------|--------|------------------|
| SDN | OFAC | Daily |
| Entity List | BIS | Weekly |
| Denied Persons | BIS | Weekly |
| Debarred Parties | State | Weekly |
| Unverified List | BIS | Monthly |
| Uyghur Forced Labor | DHS | As updated |
| Foreign Sanctions Evaders | OFAC | As updated |

**Data Required:** All public, available via government APIs/downloads

---

### 4.3 Trade Statistics Dashboard

**Problem:** We have USITC data but don't visualize it well.

**Solution:**
1. Build interactive dashboards
2. Trend charts (volume, value over time)
3. Country/product breakdowns
4. Compare to previous periods

**Visualizations:**
- Top 10 import sources by product
- Trade balance trends
- Tariff rate distributions
- YoY growth by HS chapter

**Data Required:** USITC API (we already have integration)

## 5. BUILD VS BUY ANALYSIS

### Build (Free/Public Data)

| Capability | Source | Effort | Maintenance | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| HTS schedules | USITC | Done | Low | ✅ Done |
| Trade statistics | USITC API | Done | Low | ✅ Done |
| FTA rules text | USTR | Medium | Low | ✅ Done |
| CBP rulings | rulings.cbp.gov | Medium | Medium | ⏸️ Deferred |
| Denied party lists | OFAC/BIS | Medium | Medium | ✅ Done |
| PGA requirements | ACE appendix | Small | Low | ✅ Done |
| ADD/CVD orders | ITA | Small | Medium | ✅ Done |
| Federal Register | federalregister.gov | Medium | Medium | ✅ Done |

### Buy (Licensed Data)

| Capability | Vendor Options | Cost Range | ROI |
|------------|----------------|------------|-----|
| BOL data | ImportGenius, ImportKey, Panjiva | $10K-100K/yr | Medium |
| Company data | D&B, ZoomInfo | $20K-80K/yr | Low initially |
| Contact data | ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha | $5K-30K/yr | Medium |

### Recommendation

**Phase 1-2:** Build everything from public data first
- Proves demand before spending on licenses
- $0 data cost, just dev time
- Differentiates on AI/UX, not data access

**Phase 3+:** License BOL data if demand proven
- Start with cheapest provider (ImportKey ~$10K)
- Upsell to Pro tier to cover costs
- Only expand to company data if strong demand

|------|--------|------------|
| BOL data cost too high | Can't offer competitively | Start with cheapest provider, prove demand first |
| Low demand for intelligence | Wasted dev time | Build free features first, validate interest |
| Data quality issues | Bad user experience | QA pipeline, user feedback loops |
| Competitor response | Price war | Focus on AI/UX advantages they can't copy |
| Regulatory changes | Data access restricted | Diversify data sources |
